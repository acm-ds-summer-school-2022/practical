# Day 8 Practical Session Materials
## Deep Learning and computer vision models for generating high resolution climate projections

* The intention of this hands-on is to provide a quick starter into implementing climate model data and remote sensing data for ***Downscaling***. 

* The notebook [*Downscaling.ipynb*](/Downscaling.ipynb) will cover the entire hands-on exercise end-to-end. It is recommended to execute on 
[Google Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/acm-ds-summer-school-2022/practical/blob/main/day8/Downscaling.ipynb). For convenience, only the directory **day8** is set to be cloned within the notebook.

* Hyperlinks have been provided within the notebook pointing out the suggested literature.

* For the *Augmented ConvLSTM* case study, a small-scale dataset has been provided within '*/Data*', go through the paper mentioned in the notebook to generate your own dataset at different scale and consisting of other/more climate variables.
